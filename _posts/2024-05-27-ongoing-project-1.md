This project focuses on the effects and underlying mechanisms of cognitive reappraisal interventions on traumatic memories in college students. Based on memory reconsolidation mechanisms, the research aims to modify the emotional impact of traumatic memories and improve mental health outcomes. Various psychological experimental techniques and brain imaging methods will be used to assess these interventions' effectiveness and neural basis. This project is supported by the Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Research Youth Fund and the Shenzhen Basic Research Natural Science Foundation.
