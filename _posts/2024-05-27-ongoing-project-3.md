This project investigates the neural computational mechanisms underlying reward learning deficits in patients with depressive disorders. Using a combination of neuroimaging, computational modeling, and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, the study aims to elucidate how reward processing is disrupted in depression and to develop effective interventions to address these deficits. This project is funded by the Shenzhen Basic Research Natural Science Foundation.
