This project investigates the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying abnormal fear reversal in patients with anxiety disorders. The research aims to identify specific neural pathways and biomarkers associated with fear reversal deficits using advanced neuroimaging techniques, neuromodulation, and psychological experimental methods with computational modeling (e.g., reinforcement learning). Findings from this study may contribute to the development of more accurate diagnoses and treatments for anxiety disorders. This project is funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China.
