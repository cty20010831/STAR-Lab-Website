Our lab is dedicated to advancing mental health research through three primary lines of investigation. First, we develop innovative therapeutic approaches for PTSD and MDD by studying memory reconsolidation mechanisms. This involves using experimental psychological techniques and brain imaging to understand and modify traumatic memories. Second, we explore neurocomputational mechanisms underlying anxiety and depressive disorders. By integrating brain imaging, psychological tasks, and computational modeling, we aim to uncover how neural activity and behavior interact to influence these conditions. Third, we conduct public mental health research using survey-based studies to analyze trends, risk factors, and protective factors, particularly in minority populations, to inform effective public health interventions and policies.
