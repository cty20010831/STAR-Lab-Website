# About
Welcome to STAR Lab! The STAR laboratory is based at Shenzhen Kangning Hospital (Shenzhen Mental Health Center, The Affiliated Mental Health Center of Southern University of Science and Technology). It is equipped with all the necessary instruments for our project, including several multi-channel physiological recorders, several sets of TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation), tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation) and two sets of 3.0 T Siemens MRI systems with ancillary equipment. The facility has all the necessary instruments and equipment for our projects. There is an adequate supply of patients with anxiety and depressive disorders to ensure the smooth running of all projects carried out in our laboratory.

## Research Interests
{%

This line of research focuses on the development of innovative therapeutic approaches based on cross-species reconsolidation research for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). We use a range of experimental psychological techniques to understand how negative/traumatic memories can be altered or disrupted to reduce pathological symptoms. Brain imaging techniques, such as fMRI, are used to monitor changes in brain activity and structure before/during/after the intervention. We aim to develop new evidence-based methods of modifying maladaptive memories to achieve long-term relief of PTSD and MDD symptoms.

This line of research interest aims to elucidate the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms that contribute to anxiety and depressive disorders. By integrating brain imaging techniques with various psychological tasks (aversive/reward learning, decision-making, etc.) and computational modeling, we seek to understand how behavior and neural activity interact to influence symptoms of anxiety and depression. Non-invasive brain stimulation methods (e.g., TMS, tDCS) are also used to investigate causal relationships between brain regions and changes in computational parameters. Our goal is to develop computational models that can explain anxiety and depression and provide insight into potential therapeutic targets and interventions.

This line of research focuses on studying public mental health through survey-based studies. We use both cross-sectional and longitudinal research designs to collect data on mental health trends, risk factors, and protective factors in different populations, with a particular interest in minority groups. Statistical techniques, including structural equation modeling and network analysis, are used to identify patterns and relationships within survey data. By analyzing how different factors interact and influence mental health outcomes over time, we aim to develop evidence-based recommendations for public health interventions and policies.
